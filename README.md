- 👋 Hi, I’m @Benrex777
- 👀 I’m interested in game development. But I'm a slow worker and I'm easily distracted. This is probably not a good combination when I want to do everything from scratch. c++, vulkan, 3-d Engine, ecosimulator and many things more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...to keep working on a project. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet. 
- 📫 How to reach me I'm pretty active on my YouTube channel "Benrex777". I don't post many videos but I'm active in the commentsections of the videos I watch. As long as I'm not famous and I'm not thrown from YouTube I will respond to almost anything.
